I have used a single IC stereo amplifier which is based on TDA7377. This TDA7377 can be configured in different wattage modes. Here I am using 1 channel for subwoofer and other one for speaker. TDA IC can work with single 12volt power supply. And due to class AB operation need a very little heat sink. I can use this IC in bridge mode or in simple mode. Because it has 4 channel max output which can give 6w per channel on a 4ohm load.
